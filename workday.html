                        With its many deadends and dissimilar UI patterns, Workday is difficult to navigate through for both once-a-day users and for users who live and breathe the system.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I played with this thought when I joined Workday’s Design System (Canvas) team in Summer 2019. In my and the team’s discovery of a frustrating, reward-less navigation experience, we kickstarted the development of the “App Hub”, a UI pattern focused on organizing tasks and ways to champion the employee-user.<span class="iconify" id="Illustration1" data-icon="bytesize:arrow-right" data-inline="false"></span>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Because this pattern is in development, I can only talk about in private presentations. Please contact me for more information.

                    <h3>Designing systems is like designing fractals. Nothing is at a stand-still, and everything is constantly evolving. At Workday, it was just as important to develop partnerships across the organization than it was to design a joyful experience for users.  Aligning efforts was the first step to building a great product.</h3>
