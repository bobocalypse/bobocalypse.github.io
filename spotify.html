                    <p id="introtext">
                        Music does a lot to enhance the experience of physical activity. Whenever I jog, I always pop in my headphones and match my pace and heart rate with the high bpm of the EDM that I love. Using Spotify on my smartwatch is convenient during runs, but the small interface makes it cumbersome to interact with.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Inspired by these experiences, I and a team of designer-friends envisioned Spotify x C.UI, a conversational interface that surfaces songs based on users’ music preferences as well as their current activity levels.<span class="iconify" id="Illustration1" data-icon="bytesize:arrow-right" data-inline="false"></span>

                    <p>
                        For us, the immediate opportunity was in the space of interaction—the small, tactile-based menus of our Apple Watches were always frustrating to navigate through. An epiphany struck, and we soon recognized that the fitness-related data gathered by smartwatches gave our C.UI an entirely new meaning.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Just asking about how a user taps a watch wasn’t enough. For example, we found that high-intensity activity lead to a handful of sweat-covered touchscreens and high BPM songs blaring out of headphones.

                        Mapping out the explorations we developed gave us a foundation for where a Spotify C.UI’s personality might stand. We took what we learned from these one-offs and merged them with our survey of Spotify’s brand and product services.
