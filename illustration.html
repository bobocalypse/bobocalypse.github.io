                        Systems thinking is a practice of storytelling. Storytelling is a form of systems thinking.

                        Representing characters and the cultures they’re from, whether real or lore, isn’t a two-dimensional approach. As a budding illustrator, I’ve become very interested in discovering different ways to champion and authentically represent the people and places that I get inspiration from. For me, this is a systematic approach, with lots of conversations, watching videos of plants, and driving around on Google Street View.

                        Inspired by Roald Dahl’s The Big Friendly Giant, I imagined what it could be like to humanize the BFG. For me, the clear translation was in the form of a hiker. This is his home, up on the top of a snowy forest hill.

                        I read an editorial about people spending too much time in the bathroom on their phones. Doing what? Listening to music, probably. Could be looking at other things. I figure it’s sorta like an island paradise where it’s all you. No having to worry about anyone else. Just pure independent bliss.
